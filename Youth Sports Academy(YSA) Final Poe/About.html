    <h1><u><i>About Us</i></u></h1>

    <p>
        We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to helping young people participate in sports 
        so they can focus on chasing their dreams and avoid negative influences in the community.
        Our goal is to provide opportunities for growth both on and off the field. Our programs are 
        designed to be inclusive, ensuring that every child, regardless of background, has the chance 
        to participate, grow, and thrive.
    </p>

    <h2><u><i>Our History</i></u></h2>
    <p>
        Founded in 2018, we have been serving the community by involving multiple sports and 
        encouraging community participation. Our organisation has succeeded because of strong community support.
    </p>

    <h2><u><i>Our Vision and Mission</i></u></h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Mission:</strong> To use sport as a tool for personal development, physical fitness, and social skills, 
        while promoting healthy lifestyles and community engagement. We ensure that youth learn life lessons 
        that will lead to future success. By combining structured training, mentorship, and community support, 
        we aim to create opportunities for every child to develop not only as an athlete but also as a responsible 
        and confident individual.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Vision:</strong> To help youth realize their personal worth so that each one makes a positive contribution 
        to society. We aim to create a healthy, active, and confident generation, providing quality support regardless 
        of background. We envision a future where youth are equipped to pursue athletic dreams and build meaningful 
        contributions to society.
    </p>
