=======
my website is based on sports academy, it actual helping the youth to stay away from roads 
and focus on chasing their dreams, that will put them them somewhere in life.

For this assignment, I was asked to upgrade my basic website by adding new features using JavaScript and CSS. My main goals were to make the site more interactive, look more modern, and work better on phones. This report shows all the changes I have made. 

I added a JavaScript image Gallery Lightbox; to ensure it makes viewing photos on my website a much better experience, like professional websites. 

I fixed search bar validation; to give users clear feedback and prevent useless empty searches. 

I added a Hamburger Menu for mobile users; this fix makes it responsive and easy to navigate on any device. 

I put in Social Media Links; for my visitors to easily find and follow my social media pages directly from my site. 

I updated the CSS Styling; the new styling makes it look more professional and visually appealing. 

I added Meta Tags to the HTML; I learned that meta tags are important for SEO and making sure the site is truly mobile friendly. 

I added a Validation form to the Contact & News Form; to prevent people from sending incomplete messages.
